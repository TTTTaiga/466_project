## About this Project

> Predicting the next word based on the earlier text still is a big problem to research. Additionally, prediction problems are the basic aspect in many certain problems in the NLP area. Therefore, this prediction problem is really important and valuable in both research and practical area.

> In our project, we will concentrate on the different probability distributions over the next word prediction given by two famous language models. The reason for choosing those two methods is that the RNN method shows a good ability when facing a short sequence prediction problem but has only short-term memory. In the contrast, GRU model is a new format of the LSTM model, which has a good ability to deal with long sequence prediction problems.


## How to use the project

- Download the file: model_now.ipynb
- Open it using Jupyter Notebook or Colab
- Run the code till the 3rd from last part ("define the model") to get graphs
- Run the code tull the final part is used to generate output by the trained model
